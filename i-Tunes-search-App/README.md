Steps to run the application:

1. Run npm install and it will install all the dependencies along with the node modules. Also, make sure to have react-scripts@2.1.8 as my system was compatible with this version only.

2. The application will run on _localhost:3000_ server.

3. In the home page , you will have an option to search for artist/album.

In case any error occurs , please let me know because the application is running fine in my system.
